Installing SNVPhyl
==================

SNVPhyl is implemented as workflow and suite of tools within [Galaxy][].  Galaxy provides a web-interface for running SNVPhyl and managing files, as well as the ability to connect to a high performance computing environment.

To install SNVPhyl within an existing Galaxy environment, please see the [SNVPhyl Galaxy][] install guide.  If you do not have an existing Galaxy environment, please refer to the [SNVPhyl Docker][] or [SNVPhyl Virtual Machine][] install guides for instructions on running SNVPhyl and Galaxy using Docker or virtual machines.  Alternatively, please refer to the [Galaxy Installation][] documents for setting up a local Galaxy instance.
