Installing Plasmid Profiler
==================

Plasmid Profiler is implemented as workflow and suite of tools within [Galaxy][].  Galaxy provides a web-interface for running Plasmid Profiler and managing files, as well as the ability to connect to a high performance computing environment.

To install Plasmid Profiler within an existing Galaxy environment, please see the [PlasmidProfiler Galaxy][] install guide.  If you do not have an existing Galaxy environment, please refer to the [PlasmidProfiler Docker][] install guide for instructions on running PlasmidProfiler and Galaxy using Docker.  Alternatively, please refer to the [Galaxy Installation][] documents for setting up a local Galaxy instance.
