# R Package Installation

## From CRAN

A '.tar.gz' package can be downloaded directly from [CRAN][] and installed to your local R library.  

From the terminal:
```
$R CMD INSTALL Plasmidprofiler_X.X.X.tar.gz
```
Then inside your R session run the following command:
```
library(Plasmidprofiler)
```

## Install in RStudio

If using [RStudio][] then installation is as easy as clicking 'install' on the packages pane and searching for 'Plasmidprofiler' from the CRAN repository. Be sure to install all dependencies as well.
